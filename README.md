# Pong Game Starter

A starter project for a basic pong game using SVGs.

## Setup

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

**Install dependencies:**

`$ npm install`

**Run locally with the Parcel dev server:**

`$ npm start`

Once you run the start command you can access your project at http://localhost:3000.

Read more about the [Parcel web application bundler here](https://parceljs.org/).

## Deploy

The deployment workflow for this project will be a bit different from what you've used when deploying simple static websites.

To deploy your finished Pong project as a GitHub page, you must first **update the `predeploy` script in the `package.json` file with the name of your repo.**

For example, if your repo URL is:

https://github.com/bob/pong-project

Update the `predeploy` script as follows:

```json
"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url /pong-project",
```

Once you have done this, you can run:

`$ npm run deploy`

Now check out your deployed site ðŸ™‚

### ################################ Developer Diary

After doing the code along and thus getting everything going at base level, I left the programming for the weekend. The next day I encountered issues with the program that I tryed to resolve but anything I did resulted in nothing chaging; even after making drastic changes. After cheking the sources in chrome inspector I realized that chrome was not updating the source files; every change I made was not taking effect. I ended up reaching to staff but I was able to get it going with a reboot before Anvit got back to me. Sadly this set me back an hour and a bit.

I am still making a few spelling or cap errors that are setting me back a bit of time. I tried tweaking the paddles a bit and ended up putting a capital letter in one of them by mistake... sigh..
